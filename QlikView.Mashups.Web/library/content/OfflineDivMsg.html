Unfortunately in the online demo only fakes are shown, so you'll see just images <b>how the result would look like</b>.
<br /><br />
The reason for that is that calling a different domain (like http://eu.demo.qlikview.com as used in the 
opendoc.htm and singleobject.htm integration examples) would cause a <b>violation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" target="_blank" class="lnkBlue">same origin policy</a></b>.

To get the examples running, follow the <a href="LocalSetup.html" class="lnkBlue">instruction how to set up this microsite on your computer</a>.
